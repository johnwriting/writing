# The three holes in the box I made.

Every morning I put a cardboard box on my head. I cut a hole on each outward-facing side, except for one side, so there’s three holes.

When I look through the first hole, I see a wonderful world. My job is interesting, my stomach is full, and I know tomorrow will be the same way. The city is bustling with life and there’s something interesting around every corner. The sun shines well through this hole.

On days I feel down, I look through the second hole. This hole is smaller, so I can only focus on one thing at a time, and it’s much darker inside my box. I invent stories about people I see on the street, curse the cars that drive in front of me, and argue with people in my head. 

If I wander into the forest, or visit a park, I turn the box to the last hole. This is the biggest hole, by far. I can see everything, but in a different way than normal. Most especially, I see the trees, the flowers, and the wonderful people in my life. I don’t see concrete, or my phone, or think about politics.

It’s strange to live with this box on my head. I wonder what other people’s boxes look like, if they have them. I bet if I could see their boxes, I could get to know them better, because I could see what shape the holes are. Maybe I could ask them.

One day, I want to cut a hole in the fourth side of the box. I wonder what looking through that would be like. Or maybe, on the other hand, growing older means filling in some of your holes, so you have fewer to look through, or connecting them together so you can see the gaps between them. 

Ideally, I’d like to take the box off altogether. I want to see the sky and watch the birds. Maybe then, I could see what the box looks like from the outside.
