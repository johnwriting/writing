# Second date

On the second night, I took her home with me. She held just my forearm, too short to reach the crease of my elbow, commenting on the late-January Christmas lights lining the sidewalk. We talked politics, like usual. My opinions were just alright, from what I could tell.

The way she spoke reminded me of no one. The black locks bouncing in her stride looked okay. Her face was perfectly pleasing to me, though I mostly looked at her chest.

“This is where the magic happens,” I said as we crossed the threshold to my living room.

“Ha ha,” she said.

I started up a documentary, making good on the flimsy excuse I’d made to invite her over. We started making out when we sat down.

She was a fine kisser.

It was getting late, so:

“You, know, there’s more room on my bed.”

“Ha ha,” she said.

She gave me a fine hand job.

When she was in the shower afterward, I noticed her socks were tie-die. Purple and green, I think, swirled around a few times. Did she make them?

“Did you make them?”

“Oh, no, I don’t think so.”

“Cool.”

When she left, I thought about my last second date, a year or so ago. I thought about my last third date, a year minus four days ago, and the ring I’d begun designing in my head halfway through it. 

I don’t think I’ll design anything else for a while.
