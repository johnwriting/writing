# Free radical

At first, they were lonely.

Avoiding eye contact at bars.

Snuggling into their blankets to escape into their computer.

Scrolling through medium-ugly faces on their phone to feel a little hopeful.

All at once, individually, in their own safe lonesome, they puttered away solitary lives pining for something more.

To deny a human the right to company is to kill the human. To rip away their covalent partner and convert them to a free radical, makes them free but radically imprisoned. By guilt. By shame. Spiraling thoughts searching for answers, hidden behind a smile and “I’m doing fine.” This isn’t how they’re supposed to be.

But one day, it changes. Not little by little, but with one little gesture. A stranger invites them to somewhere or another. Their coworker drags them out for a beer or two. Someone _wants_ them. And suddenly, they are person who sees other people again. Those thoughts before, nah, actually things aren’t so bad. In fact, there’s a whole lot beautiful about the world if you pause to consider it. And you know what, I’m a lot of fun if you get to know me.

When before they were an atom cruising through the vaccuum, they are now bound by the force of another, and everything is balanced again.
