# Pebbles

Back and forth, back and forth
Each time rounder and easier to hold
As the tide swells and subsides

Once, I thought, life went one way
Though sometimes jagged with gaps to jump
But now, I see, our journey meanders by force of waves

Before, I sought a buoy to align my breast stroke
With promise that soon I’d tie up to bear the current
But too often I’d tire with much distance to go

Now, it’s clear, this current is home
My tide carries me where it wants me to go
And with time, I’m certain, I’ll wash up upon a shore
And smile at tumbling pebbles
