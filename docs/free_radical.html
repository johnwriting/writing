    <h1>Free radical</h1>
<p>At first, they were lonely.</p>
<p>Avoiding eye contact at bars.</p>
<p>Snuggling into their blankets to escape into their computer.</p>
<p>Scrolling through medium-ugly faces on their phone to feel a little hopeful.</p>
<p>All at once, individually, in their own safe lonesome, they puttered away solitary lives pining for something more.</p>
<p>To deny a human the right to company is to kill the human. To rip away their covalent partner and convert them to a free radical, makes them free but radically imprisoned. By guilt. By shame. Spiraling thoughts searching for answers, hidden behind a smile and “I’m doing fine.” This isn’t how they’re supposed to be.</p>
<p>But one day, it changes. Not little by little, but with one little gesture. A stranger invites them to somewhere or another. Their coworker drags them out for a beer or two. Someone <em>wants</em> them. And suddenly, they are person who sees other people again. Those thoughts before, nah, actually things aren’t so bad. In fact, there’s a whole lot beautiful about the world if you pause to consider it. And you know what, I’m a lot of fun if you get to know them.</p>
<p>When before they were an atom cruising through the vaccuum, they are now bound by the force of another, and everything is balanced again.</p>
