    <h1>Party</h1>
<p>Jack stumbles onto his patio with a Rolling Rock stuck between two fingers like a cigarette. He’s had two full hands’ worth at this point. He runs his hand down the rusty railing of the hundred-year-old townhouse until finding a comfortable spot to lean on and looks down onto the parade of laughing party retreaters below. </p>
<p>Freshman year is romanticized, but that’s all bullshit, he thinks. These big budget movies with twenty-somethings playing near-high-schoolers, being all pretty and fucking each other every weekend, blowing off class to throw back a forty walking down the sidewalk. What a fantasy. Jack’s been to three weeks of classes and this is the first real break he’s gotten from studying the useless opinions of some dumb fucks who’ve been dead for a hundred years. His hand’s cramped writing out greek symbols and he’s fallen asleep at his 8am four times. What a joke; college is just the four years you can get the most drunk without any consequences.</p>
<p>The scene below is the icing on the cake. His loud-mouth roommate hitting on some girl he’s got no chance with. Loser art kids smoking cigarettes giving the finger to cancer science. The girl he tried to hook up with leaning against the porch, texting some loser, probably. Is this what he’s got to look forward to?</p>
<p>He hears the door creak open behind him.</p>
<p>“Hey dude, what’s up?”</p>
<p>It’s some random girl from the party, probably one Natty Light away from puking on his shoes.</p>
<p>Jack glances at her. “Hey.”</p>
<p>“Getting out of that sweaty air?”</p>
<p>She’s at least a little pretty, but that’s probably just the green bottle talking.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.” He turns back to the crowd beneath. “I just get tired of talking to people for so long.”</p>
<p>She smirks and leans next to him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, me too.” She pulls out a joint. “You smoke?”</p>
<p>Jack waves her off. “Nah, my buddy back home got fucked up on that shit and dropped out of school.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on, don’t give me that reefer madness BS. I’m hittin’ straight A’s so far.” She laughs and pulls out a lighter. “So this is your house?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>“Who do you live with? They hanging out here?”</p>
<p>Jack’s head’s still over the railing. “Just those guys down there. Not sure if we’re getting along too well, to be honest.” He tilts the bottle up again.</p>
<p>The weed smells sweet. Like a cloud of sugar floating up from a candy factory. The girl coughs a couple times and offers her pinched fingers over the railing.</p>
<p>“Trade ya?”</p>
<p>Eh, why not? The Rolling Rock is a powerful negotiator.</p>
<p>His hit gets cut off by a coughing fit and he blows the smoke into her face.</p>
<p>“Oh, christ I’m sorry, *cough* *cough* I don’t *cough* do this a lot.” She hands him the beer to calm his throat.</p>
<p>They stand there quietly for a few minutes, looking down the street, looking up at the stars, studying all the junk in the neighbor’s back yard.</p>
<p>“Mmm,” she says, her eyelids drooped halfway, “’s a good party, man.” She shuffles closer.</p>
<p>Sophie, the girl, has never been to something like this before. She crossed over from out west, in Utah, where even coffee is off-limits. Her few degenerate friends managed to find weed every once in a while, but they never had a whole house to themselves.</p>
<p>“You likes parties, guy?” She looks him in the eye.</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’re alright. Just go on too long sometimes.” He reaches out his non-beer hand, “I’m Jack, by the way.”</p>
<p>“Sophia.” </p>
<p>It’s not on her birth certificate, but she likes the way it sounds. And his hand sure is strong.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>“And there’s the, um, Painty Way,” Jack says, drawing an invisible line on his ceiling.</p>
<p>“Man you’re lucky you waited til now to make that joke.” Sophia turns her naked shoulder away from him and snuggles into the blankets. Her back is covered in freckles, and he can’t help but see constellations.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Jack says, a little too sober, “You hungry?”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>The shuttle runs all night long. Big and blue, lined with grey seats cleaned daily of vomit and takeout. Jack and Sophia sit in the back so they can watch the traffic behind them and make out every few minutes. She’s still a little pretty. Decently pretty, even, under the fluorescent lights. They hold hands for the last five minutes of the ride, and she rests her really-quite-pretty face on his shoulder. </p>
<p>Sophia wakes as the shuttle stops, and they hop out into the city square.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Jack says as she starts toward the burrito stand, “I’ve got a better idea. I’ll be back in a second."</p>
<p>Sophia grabs her arms in the nearly-winter air, cursing herself for not taking one of his sweatshirts before they left. This boy is a little crazy, sure, but he's fun as hell. Nobody was like this back in Utah.</p>
<p>Jack rushes back with a six pack of Rolling Rock.</p>
<p>“So the place I was thinking of was closed, but I got the next best thing.”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>They chase burrito with shitty beer sitting on the cold sidewalk cement. Jack’s coat is around her, like in the movies.</p>
<p>“I swear! She said that, verbatim. <em>Boston is full of sinners, Sophie, you’re going to end up you-know-where if you take this scholarship</em>.” She polishes off the bottle. “What a bitch.”</p>
<p>Jack looks at her the way her first boyfriend used to, before he moved away.</p>
<p>“Sorry to hear,” he slurs through half a burrito-mouth, “I’m glad Boston’s not that way.” He swallows the beans and rice. “You know I thought tonight was winding down before you walked onto my balcony.” His face turns serious. “And before you were there I was bitching to myself about how college kids talk a big game about having a good time, but aren’t really having a good time, ya know?” He takes another sip. “But I gotta say, I’m having a good time.”</p>
<p>She smiles and holds his arm.</p>
<p>“You want to walk back?”</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>At 5 am, the streets are empty. Sophia and Jack rock their arms together, linked at the bottom, taking small, tired steps in the blue darkness of dawn. This is <em>life</em> he thinks, <em>this is what it’s all about</em>. He hasn’t thought about class or any dumb shit like that since he saw her tonight. He’s an impulsive romancer, a player, a movie star. If he weren’t so tired he’d make up a song on the spot and serenade her accompanied by the serene silence of the sunrise. <em>Wow, did I just make that up</em>? He wonders, reciting the poem in his head.</p>
<p>They’re halfway home.</p>
<p>“Hey, can you wait a minute?” Sophia stops. “These heels are killing me. Mind if we sit here?”</p>
<p>The wooden-slat bench marks the entrance of a small park.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>The couple collapse onto the bench and entangle themselves together. Sophia is face-up in his lap, quickly fading to sleep. She’s the prettiest girl he’s ever seen.</p>
<p>An orange glow paints the trees in the distance. Clouds burn soft amber, and the cityscape glows to life. Jack kicks his leg up a bit, but she's fast asleep. He runs his hand down her torso and grabs the zipper on his jacket, pulling it up to meet her chin. Her hair smells like flowers. He sits back and rests his elbow on her side.</p>
<p><em>What a beautiful morning</em>, he thinks, falling asleep to birdsong with his first love in his lap.</p>
