    <h1>My Biscuit</h1>
<p>They came in the night for my Biscuit. Dressed in landlord-chic, trotting around in black ski masks made of kashmere. They count their bills like insomniacs do sheep, up until infinity, perhaps, watching fives and tens and twenties march across their imagination and drop into their fat little piggy banks they won’t touch until their spoiled children dip their oil-greased hands into it to buy their third yacht, which they bought from an ever-pressing compulsion to wash their emptiness away with the coarse but cleansing strength of boundless wealth. Not their fault, I hear my brother saying now, they’re just a symptom of a larger problem. And in some way, yes, fine—but they still <em>let</em> the system take control of their brain. Greed knocked at the door of their conscience and they let them in, letting them keep their shoes on even. Perhaps this was because there was no one else in the house, and they were lonely. Or maybe it was because their father always said Greed was a nice fellow, and did more good than harm, and anyone those hippie liberals don’t know anything about the “real world”. But is that true, brother? No one asks for their savings account to watch them die. No one calls their bank in the middle of the night when their thoughts get too dark. Don’t answer the door.</p>
