    <h1>Second date</h1>
<p>On the second night, I took her home with me. She held just my forearm, too short to reach the crease of my elbow, commenting on the late-January Christmas lights lining the sidewalk. We talked politics, like usual. My opinions were just alright, from what I could tell.</p>
<p>The way she spoke reminded me of no one. The black locks bouncing in her stride looked okay. Her face was perfectly pleasing to me, though I mostly looked at her chest.</p>
<p>“This is where the magic happens,” I said as we crossed the threshold to my living room.</p>
<p>“Ha ha,” she said.</p>
<p>I started up a documentary, making good on the flimsy excuse I’d made to invite her over. We started making out when we sat down.</p>
<p>She was a fine kisser.</p>
<p>It was getting late, so:</p>
<p>“You, know, there’s more room on my bed.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha,” she said.</p>
<p>She gave me a fine hand job.</p>
<p>When she was in the shower afterward, I noticed her socks were tie-die. Purple and green, I think, swirled around a few times. Did she make them?</p>
<p>“Did you make them?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“Cool.”</p>
<p>When she left, I thought about my last second date, a year or so ago. I thought about my last third date, a year minus four days ago, and the ring I’d begun designing in my head halfway through it. </p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll design anything else for a while.</p>
