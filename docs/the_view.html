    <h1>The view from nearly the top</h1>
<p>Mailbox peak is a grueling one-mile hike east of Seattle. Laid flat, it would take ten minutes, but add a thousand feet of elevation and a scramble at its crest and it’s two lung-sucking hours.</p>
<p>“Every hiker in the area should try it at least once,” Andy’s friend told him last month.</p>
<p>Their four-door Sudan pulled into the parking lot 10am on Sunday, at the start of April. Rachael made sure to pull the e-brake and lock all the doors as the two climbed out of the car, double-water-bottled mini-packs strapped to their backs.</p>
<p>“Wow, couldn’t have asked for a better day!” Andy said as Rachel took a swig of water. “Here, I’ll get that for you.” He put her water bottle back in the backpack.</p>
<p>“Thanks, babe. It is gorgeous out. I can smell the new life in the air.” She stuck her nose up, high enough to meet Andy’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“You have lovely nostrils, my dear.”</p>
<p>They set off on the trailhead, leaving tracks in the dew-laden grass. All around, flower buds poked out from the underbrush and bird conversation blitted across the path. Warm sunshine spot-lit openings in the canopy, slowing the couple down as Rachael stopped to bask in the warmth. They cupped sweaty palms and toured the burgeoning community.</p>
<p>“Days like this make everything else just melt away,” Andy said, watching a woodpecker head-bang to its own song. Rachael nodded, preoccupied with cataloging the species of berry bushes floating past her feet.</p>
<p>“I wish every day were like this,” he continued.</p>
<p>The grass shrank into the mud as they climbed the first hundred feet of the trail. Ancient granite began to break the surface, pimpled with pits of rainwater from the evening before, dark under the ever-growing shadow of the canopy. The trail zig-zagged like an earthen skyscraper, gaining tens of feet with each double-back. Andy tripped on a decaying root sprawling out from a “zag” corner, sending methane-scented wood chips down onto the “zig” below. Every so often a squirrel darted up a tree in the distance.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>After only fifteen minutes of zippering up the mini-mountain, Rachel paused at an elbow and grabbed the water bottle out of her bag.</p>
<p>“Phew, Brad wasn’t kidding, this is brutal,” she said between heavy breaths.</p>
<p>“Yeah, jeez, but it’s a good kind of tired, eh?” Andy sat on the boulder beside her and took the next swig. “Really gets the blood flowing!”</p>
<p>Rachel wandered over to the other side of the “zag” to inspect a berry-laden bush.</p>
<p>Damn, too red.</p>
<p>She continued off-trail to a patch of nearly blossomed lilacs.</p>
<p>You’ll be ready soon, don’t worry. I love your purple streaks, by the way.</p>
<p>She knelt down and toyed with the delicate petals, smiling.</p>
<p>Four perfect bulbs. The bees’ll be happy to meet you in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Andy was staring a green map on his phone with a squiggle down the middle.</p>
<p>“We’ve made it just about a quarter of the way. Damn, babe, we’re killing it!”</p>
<p>I see one of you is an early bloomer! I’m sure your sisters wouldn’t mind if I took you home to show you off, would they?</p>
<p>The petals hugged her nose as specks of dirt rained down from the stem.</p>
<p>“Hey Rach?”</p>
<p>“Yes, babe?”</p>
<p>“I said we’ve made big headway already!”</p>
<p>“Wonderful!”</p>
<p>She trotted over and gave Andy a peck on the lips.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep on, then!”</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Mid-way up the mountain, Rachel was dragging her feet.</p>
<p>“Everything OK, babe?” Andy asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, just tired.” She stayed fixated on the terrain.</p>
<p>Andy paused and looked up at Rachel as she kicked pebbles off the trail.</p>
<p>“You know I can tell when something’s up.”</p>
<p>She kept walking.</p>
<p>“Well we’re almost there, hope you’re ready for an amazing view!” He continued, grabbing the water bottle out of his backpack as he caught up with her. “More water, babe?”</p>
<p>She waved it off and picked up her pace. “If we stop now, we’ll be too tired to get to the top.”</p>
<p>He left her some distance. “You know you’ve got to stay hydrated, though, we’re sweating up a storm up here.” He laughed.</p>
<p>She rounded a corner and to put one zig of elevation between them. “I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Andy gave up on catching her and sat on a rock beside the trail. His scrawny legs itched from gettin whacked by a tree branch earlier. He cupped his dirt-stained hands over his eyes and exhaled into his palms.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>The couple trekked the last quarter in silence. At this height, cars weren’t so much ants as they were mice, racing in a paved maze in the distance. You could still hear their seventy-mile-an-hour whoosh if you listened carefully, which annoyed Andy. The sky bore no clouds to block the sun, which illuminated the trees and lakes with bright greens and flickering blues.</p>
<p>Andy took a meditation class once. It taught him how to listen to his own mind as it thought, which it turned out takes a tremendous amount of focus. The strenuous hike made it hard to focus.</p>
<p>Rachel spent the silence wondering what the plants thought of this excursion. When plants invade a human home, we usually kill them. But she reconsidered—maybe plants aren’t as petty as humans. Surely not. She smiled.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>At last, the leaves cleared to reveal a steep cone of meadow grass patched with dirt, winding up to a rocky summit with a mailbox poking out the top.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s all that’s left, huh?” Andy said, shading his eyes.</p>
<p>“Guess so.” Rachel looked into the trees behind them.</p>
<p>“You ready?”</p>
<p>She turned back to the hilltop. Andy grasped her arm.</p>
<p>“Babe, I’m here for you.”</p>
<p>She wrapped her other arm around him and brought him close.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can do it,” she said. “It’s too high.”</p>
<p>Andy rubbed her back.</p>
<p>“It’s not that high, love, it’ll only be about twenty minutes.”</p>
<p>“I like the forest. I’ll get all hot and sweaty on that hill.”</p>
<p>“You can take your windbreaker off and put on some sunscreen.”</p>
<p>Rachel pulled back and kissed him.</p>
<p>“You know I love you, Andy.”</p>
<p>“I love you, too.”</p>
<p>A tear slid down her cheek.</p>
<p>“But…” She pulled him close again.</p>
<p>Andy closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“…You’re such an amazing person and…”</p>
<p>“Stop, please.” Andy let her go and looked her into her marbled eyes. “I just want you to be honest with me.”</p>
<p>She looked away.</p>
<p>“Rachel, I,” he searched for the words, “You’ve been like this for a while. I know something’s not right. But I can’t help or do better or say the right things if you don’t tell me what you’re feeling.”</p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>“Is it someone else?”</p>
<p>“No, I love you Andy.”</p>
<p>“Is it me?”</p>
<p>“Can we talk about this in the car?”</p>
<p>“Is it your depression?”</p>
<p>“We can talk about it in the car, babe.”</p>
<p>Andy took a couple steps toward the hill.</p>
<p>“I love you too, Rachel. But I’m going to the top. I’ll meet you in the car.”</p>
<p>He started toward the climb, but got a tap on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Wait,” she said, “here.”</p>
<p>She tucked the eager lilac behind his ear.</p>
<p>“Take a nice selfie for me, OK?”</p>
<p>Andy’s scorn relented and he gave her a kiss.</p>
<p>“Thank you, babe.”</p>
<p>He started off into the clearing. Rachel stood by, still as the trees surrounding her.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Andy pulled himself over the last few rocks and collapsed on the summit. He smiled as he caught his breath, soaking in the undisturbed sunlight.</p>
<p>When he got up, he walked over to the mailbox and opened it. A dozen postcards lined the inside, postmarked from all different states, with ink bleeding down their fronts. Andy reached into his back pocket and pulled out a yellow postcard with a picture of their home covering the first two-thirds.</p>
<p>Greetings from Capitol Hill! We don’t do too many hikes, but this one sure was a wild ride!
- Andy and Rachel</p>
<p>He slid the card into the mailbox and closed it.</p>
<p>He walked over to the edge of the summit and took in the view. The cars were ants now, and he couldn’t hear them. He took a long breath through his nose and reveled in the mountain air. From here, he could see everything: nearby farms, Mount Rainier, even the Space Needle if he looked past the haze. The world was a lot bigger from high up.</p>
<p>His thoughts wandered. He walked back through his day, to this morning at the breakfast table, to waking up next to Rachel. He jumped back to two years ago, when he was single and getting drunk on Thursdays with strangers. He watched the faces of past relationships whiz by, all the joys and hardships, all the sex and tensions. Up here, he could see how rich his life had been, and how boundless he could be if he chose.</p>
<p>He reached for his ear and pulled the lilac to his nose. It smelled beautifully. But he could only remember the scent of three of four other flowers—was this lilac so much better? Countless other species hid in the wilderness beneath him. More mountains, too, waited in the distance, some taller, some more treacherous, all of them a new experience waiting to be had. Just a morning’s journey away.</p>
<p>He took another deep breath and placed the lilac on the ground. Slowly, he walked back to the trailhead, lowered himself onto the rocks, and began his descent.</p>
